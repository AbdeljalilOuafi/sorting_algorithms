# Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in C.

## Algorithms Included

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- Selection Sort

## Usage

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in its own C file within the `sorting_algorithms` directory. To use any of these algorithms, you can directly run the pre-compiled executables or edit the source code and compile the file again.

### Example Usage:

1. **Using Pre-compiled Executables:**

   ```bash
   # Run the pre-compiled executable for Bubble Sort
   ./sorting_algorithms/bubble_sort

   # Output:
   # Original Array: 5 3 8 2 1
   # Sorted Array:   1 2 3 5 8

### Contribution
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have an idea for improving an existing algorithm, implementing a new one, or optimizing performance, feel free to open a pull request.
